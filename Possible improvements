How does stockfish evaluate the board? If we use its evalution to improve our bot, we need a description of this in the report. 
The Stockfish evaluation seems to run very slowly. How do we make it faster?
Is the bot doing what it is supposed to do? It seems to be taking some stupid moves when you're playing against it.
